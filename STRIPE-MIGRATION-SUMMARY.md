# Stripe Data Migration: Summary and Next Steps

## Current Situation

We've encountered an interesting situation where:

1. We can successfully create tables and insert data using the MCP connection directly.
2. The same tables are not accessible via the Supabase REST API.

This suggests that:
- The MCP connection might be connecting to a different database or schema than what Supabase is configured to use in its REST API
- Or there might be permission issues with the Supabase REST API access to these tables

## Successful Steps

1. We created the following custom tables for Stripe data:
   - `custom_stripe_customers`
   - `custom_stripe_subscriptions`
   - `custom_stripe_products`
   - `custom_stripe_prices`
   - `custom_stripe_invoices`
   - `custom_stripe_charges`

2. We successfully inserted test data into these tables using MCP SQL queries.

3. We created a migration script and webhooks which could work if the tables were accessible via the Supabase API.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Configure Row-Level Security (RLS) for the tables

The tables might be missing RLS policies, which could prevent API access. Try:

```sql
BEGIN;
-- Add RLS policies to the custom Stripe tables
ALTER TABLE custom_stripe_customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Allow full access to custom_stripe_customers" ON custom_stripe_customers FOR ALL TO authenticated USING (true);

-- Repeat for other tables...
COMMIT;
```

### Option 2: Create the tables through Supabase Studio

1. Log in to the Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the table creation SQL script there
4. This ensures the tables are created with the proper permissions and schema

### Option 3: Use MCP for both data migration and reading

Since we can access and modify the tables through MCP, we could:
1. Create a Supabase Edge Function that uses direct database queries instead of the REST API
2. Use MCP to run the migration script directly on the database
3. Continue using MCP for querying data when needed

### Long-term solution: Explore Supabase table configuration

Investigate why tables created through MCP aren't accessible via the REST API. This might involve:
1. Checking database roles and permissions
2. Ensuring schema configurations match
3. Setting up proper RLS policies
4. Adding tables to Supabase's tracked tables (if that's a requirement)

## Conclusion

The basic architecture we've designed is solid - creating custom tables to mirror the Stripe foreign tables and using webhooks to keep them updated. However, we need to resolve the API access issue to complete the implementation.

I recommend starting with Option 2 (creating tables through Supabase Studio) as it's the most likely to resolve the issue by ensuring tables are properly configured within Supabase.
